# FLL2021-Project

<h2>These programs (using HTML and Python) are our research project for FLL (First LEGO League) 2020-2021.</h2>

FLL is a robotics competition held every year. Teams build and program robots to solve missions. The teams also have to create a prototype for a specific challenge held each year, and present them to judges. I'm a member of one of the teams, called Wall-E Workers.

This years FLL challenge is all about sports. Specifically, the goal is to create a prototype to encourage kids to exercise. In order to solve this problem, our team decided to make an app to encourage kids to exercise.

In the app, you will start with registration page, asking the users' information (Age, Name, Email, Password). For our health app, we also asked the users' weight, height, eyesight, etc. We use this information to give recommendations for the user. Along with that, there's the sign in page too.

You will also find a public gallery, where users can post pictures of them exercising, and a private gallery, where a user can share (privately) pictures directly to the admin.

There is also a inspiration page, giving ideas on how to exercise. And finally, a analytics page (called research), to compare user exercise with others. It also has your personal data too.

We created this app to help kids who exercise too little. If you want, feel free to try out the programs yourself!

And of course, thank you for reading this.

P.S The app is still under development, and should be done around mid Feb 2021.
